    <h2>Your privacy</h2>
    <h3>All Firefox Studies</h3>
    <p>
      We collect data about important study events, such as install, uninstall, daily usage, and end of study. Studies also include an optional survey.
    </p>
    <h3>This Particular Study</h3>
    <p>
      In addition to the data collected by all Firefox Studies and your voluntary answers to the follow-up survey, here are the key things you should know about what’s happening when you participate in this study:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Firefox may adjust the settings for the site you’re on to try to fix it.</li>
    	<li>We only collect information about sites you have tried to fix</li>
    	<li>No personal information or data will be collected or recorded during the study.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>You help make Firefox better</h3>
