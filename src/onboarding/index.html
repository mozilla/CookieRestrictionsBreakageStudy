    <h2>About the Study</h2>
    <p>
      We’re testing new privacy protections in Firefox. Sometimes, increasing privacy settings can cause websites to break or function improperly. We want to protect people’s privacy without breaking the Internet. Your participation in this study will help us get there! Ready to get started? <a class="join-study" href="#">Join the study.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      If you agree to participate in this study, you’ll:
    </p>
    <ol>
    	<li>Give Firefox permission to increase your privacy settings</li>
    	<li>Report any broken sites you encounter</li>
    	<li>Let Firefox try to fix the site by using your original privacy settings</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>How will I know if something is broken?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Website looks broken or unusual</li>
    	<li>Any part of a site doesn’t load, such as a forms, comments, or widgets</li>
    	<li>Can’t log in</li>
    	<li>Can’t complete a form or transaction</li>
    	<li>Can’t view a video, for example a Facebook Live or YouTube video</li>
    	<li>Social media sharing or buttons don’t work</li>
    	<li>Customer support chats don’t load</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What will happen next</h2>
    <p>You need to <a class="join-study" href="#">join the study</a> first.</p>
    <ol>
    	<li>We’ll install an icon <span class="icon"></span> to the right of your address bar</li>
    	<li>Continue using Firefox as you normally would</li>
    	<li>If any portion of a website isn’t working properly, open the icon <span class="icon"></span></li> 
    	<li>Select “Try to Fix This Site”</li>
    	<li>Let us know if it fixes the problem</li>
    	<li>Choose to send breakage report to Firefox</li>
    	<li>The study will end on its own after about 3 weeks. Firefox will restore your original privacy settings.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Leaving the study</h2>
    <p>
      The study will expire on its own in about 3 weeks. You may leave the study early. If you don’t want to participate in this study, you can select the Leave Study button on this page. You can also disable it on the about:studies page in Firefox.  (Type about:studies into the FIrefox address bar.)
    </p>

    <h2>Your privacy</h2>
    <h3>All Firefox Studies</h3>
    <p>
      We collect data about important study events, such as install, uninstall, daily usage, and end of study. Studies also include an optional survey.
    </p>
    <h3>This Particular Study</h3>
    <p>
      In addition to the data collected by all Firefox Studies and your voluntary answers to the follow-up survey, here are the key things you should know about what’s happening when you participate in this study:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Firefox may adjust the settings for the site you’re on to try to fix it.</li>
    	<li>We only collect information about sites you have tried to fix</li>
    	<li>No personal information or data will be collected or recorded during the study.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>You help make Firefox better</h3>
    <p>
      At Mozilla, we pride ourselves on building products for you, the user! That’s why we need your help. You help us by letting us observe how you use new features and by telling us your opinions about them.
    </p>
    <p>
      By participating in this study, you will help us make better decisions on your behalf and directly shape the future of Firefox.
